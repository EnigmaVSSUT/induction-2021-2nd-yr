## Your task goes here with a folder of your Name
## Task 1

Using Node js I have made a Qoutes API 
- This API takes two parameter :
- First one is Number of qoutes that you want to see.
- Second is the Category you want : Inspirational or Funny.
- The data is stored in **MongoDB database**.



                               
<br><br>**The App is hosted here :- http://lit-springs-72664.herokuapp.com/ **<br>
