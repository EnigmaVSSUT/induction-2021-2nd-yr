# Problem Statement :

- Create a `DBMS` system **without using any databases**. You should have your own database file for storing your data. The extension is all up to you.
- Basic `CURD` operation should be operational.

### Details :

- Create a file named `database.txt` or `database.JSON` (you can name it as you like and you can change the extension too).
- Use Node **Native functions** to perform `CURD` operations.
- Every time a operation is successful the database file that you have created should be updated.

**Note :** you can consider this as an extension to the API that you have created in Task 1. Implement this feature and submit it again in the [Task Submission](.././Task%20Submission) creating a folder by `your Name task 2`. Write a detailed README explaining how you implemented this task.

#### All the best !!
